# ValidatorsAndGenerators
A JavaScript helper library to generate and validate data. 

This is a library to validate data that is coming from the user end or any other source. You can validate all types of data with regex. The generate helps you generate basic dat like current date and difference between 2 dates. We are using [`monent`](https://github.com/moment/moment) in the background.
